This code demonstrates the usage of SQLite in Python to create a database, create a table, insert data into the table, and execute a SELECT query. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    Import statement:
        The code imports the sqlite3 module, which provides an interface to SQLite databases.

    Database connection:
        The code establishes a connection to an SQLite database named 'test_database.db' using sqlite3.connect() and assigns the connection object to the variable conn.
        It also creates a cursor object c to interact with the database.

    Table creation:
        The code uses the cursor's execute() method to execute an SQL query that creates a table named 'products' if it doesn't already exist.
        The CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statement specifies the table schema with columns: product_id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), product_name (TEXT), and price (INTEGER).

    Data insertion:
        The code uses another execute() method call to insert data into the 'products' table.
        The INSERT INTO statement specifies the columns to insert data into (product_id, product_name, and price) and provides the corresponding values in a multi-valued VALUES clause.
        Each set of values in parentheses represents a separate row to be inserted.

    Committing changes:
        The code calls conn.commit() to commit the changes made to the database.

    SELECT query:
        The code executes a SELECT query using c.execute().
        The SELECT statement retrieves all rows from the 'products' table where the price is less than 400.
        The result set is obtained using c.fetchall() and assigned to the variable rset.

    Result processing and output:
        The code prints the row count of the result set using an f-string (len(rset)).
        It then iterates over each row in the result set using a for loop.
        Inside the loop, it prints the name and price values of each row using an f-string (row[1] and row[2] respectively).

    Error handling:
        The code includes exception handling using a try-except block.
        If any SQLite-related error occurs during the execution of the SQL statements, it catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints the error message.

    Database connection closing:
        The code uses a finally block to ensure that the database connection is closed using conn.close() regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

In summary, this code demonstrates the basic usage of SQLite in Python to create a database, create a table, insert data, execute a SELECT query, retrieve and process the results, and handle potential errors.
